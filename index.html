      <h2>History of Nelson Mandela</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="time-year">Childhood: 1918–1934</span>
          Main article: Mandela family
          Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province

        <li><span class="time-year">Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare: 1934–1940</span>
          Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, Mandela began his
          secondary education in 1933 at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that
          was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland.

        </li>
        <li><span class="time-year">Arriving in Johannesburg: 1941–1943:</span>
          Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and
          Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941.</li>
        <hr>
        <li><span class="time-year">Continued activism and philanthropy: 1999–2004:</span>
          Retiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family
          life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu. Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first
          autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, it remained unfinished and was only published posthumously
          in 2017.</li>
        <hr>
        <li><span class="time-year">Presidency of South Africa: 1994–1999:</span>
          The newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect
          Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive. His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994,
          televised to a billion viewers globally. The event was attended by four thousand guests, including world
          leaders from a wide range of geographic and ideological backgrounds</li>
        <hr>
        <li><span class="time-year">Illness and death: 2011–2013:</span>
          In February 2011, Mandela was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international
          attention,[344][345] before being re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012

    <blockquote class="quote">
      The significance of Mandela can be considered in two related ways. First, he has provided through his personal
      presence as a benign and honest conviction politician, skilled at exerting power but not obsessed with it to the
      point of view of excluding principles, a man who struggled to display respect to all ... Second, in so doing he
      was able to be a hero and a symbol to an array of otherwise unlikely mates through his ability, like all brilliant
      nationalist politicians, to speak to very different audiences effectively at once.
      —Bill Freund, academic[425]
